# Activity 1

This set of Scala challenges introduce exercises for working with the Scala syntax.

It includes:

* Methods, variable definitions and data types
* Conditionals
* Looping
* Initial review of Scala objects

### Instructions
In the [Exercise001Test.scala](../src/test/scala/com/techreturners/exercise001/Exercise001Test.scala) file you'll find the tests - work through each test and implement the corresponding function within the [Exercise001.scala](../src/main/scala/com/techreturners/exercise001/Exercise001.scala) file.

You can run your tests by running the following command:

```
sbt test
```
