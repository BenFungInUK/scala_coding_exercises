# Scala practice

This repository contains challenges for you undertake to build on your coding and technical ability. We will be checking over your solutions, so please ensure you push to GitHub regularly.

You may find these exercises challenging but they give you the opportunity to build on your growth mindset and commitment to programming and learning in general. 

You can always come to us if you are having any trouble.

We will be covering Scala on the Your Return to Tech course, so it's really important your problem solving skills are fresh.

If this is your first time encountering the Scala language then firstly ðŸ™Œ ðŸ™Œ ðŸ™Œ to you for working through a new language. 

Secondly, we recommend working through the [Scala tour material on their website](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/tour-of-scala.html) before working through the exercises.

## Instructions

Ok you're ready to get started. Here we'll provide instructions on how to get setup and work through the exercises.

To complete these exercises you will need to have Java and Scala installed on your computer.

Follow the link below to download and install the **Java SE Development Kit** for your laptop. 

**NOTE:** At the time of writing it is recommended to install a Long Term Support (LTS) version of the Java Development Kit in order to ensure compatibility with Scala. At the time of writing (12/2021) version 11 is the most compatible (with Scala) LTS version of Java.
