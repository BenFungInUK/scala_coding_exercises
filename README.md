# Scala practice

This repository contains challenges for you undertake to build on your coding and technical ability. We will be checking over your solutions, so please ensure you push to GitHub regularly.

You may find these exercises challenging but they give you the opportunity to build on your growth mindset and commitment to programming and learning in general. 

You can always come to us if you are having any trouble.

We will be covering Scala on the Your Return to Tech course, so it's really important your problem solving skills are fresh. 

If you'd like any Scala practice prior to starting the exercises, exercism.io provide a [great Scala track](https://exercism.org/tracks/scala)
